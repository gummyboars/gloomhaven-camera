# Gloomhaven Camera Tweaks
This mod makes a few changes to the gloomhaven camera:
- Stops the camera from rotating without user input after a character attacks
- Adds a button to general settings to disable auto-camera behavior
- Adds a hotkey to the controls menu for toggling fast animations
- Remembers the last zoom level that was used
- When restarting a round, remembers the camera rotation
